I had the pleasure of visiting
[BSides Ume 2025 (10-11 June 2025)](https://indico.neic.no/event/273/)!

## Why did I go?

There was a couple of reasons for me deciding to visit BSides;

- [Security Fest - IT Security Conference, Gothenburg, Sweden](https://securityfest.com/)
  is a ton of volunteer work for me,
  and it is probably good to take a break be a normal participant.
- [Säkerhetspodcasten](https://sakerhetspodcasten.se/) has been
  promoting BSides Ume for three years now.
  Time to see and experience what we are promoting!
- I've never participated in a BSides before.
  Could be cool to check it out.
- It has been years since I saw the north of Sweden.

## BSides concept

[BSides](https://bsides.org/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) describes itself as:

> _BSides is a community-driven [...] events [...] information security community_
> _[...] expand the spectrum of conversation_
> _[...] opportunities for individuals to both present and participate_
> _in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration._
> _It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants._
> _It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening._

Honestly I am not very social, and was very pretty tired from
SecurityFest and travel.
My social contributions could best be described as "minimal".
So maybe I personally did not implemented all ideals of BSides, even
if they are pretty sweet.

## BSides Ume

The event was hosted by
[Academic Computer Club in Umeå](https://www.accum.se/)
and was sponsored by Omegapoint, NetNordic, Truesec, PentesterLab.

The environment felt very non-commercial.
Prices was very low, initially sold at early bird discount
and then full prices as follows;
* Regular: SEK 1200.
* Student: SEK 600.

BSides Ume felt similar to a OWASP Gothenburg event but
more bare bones.
Utilizing Umeå University lecture rooms
and a very basic university restaurant
("[bamba](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bamba#Swedish)").
Also students/researchers participated in the event as speakers.

Environment felt very friendly and inclusive.

## Talks

### My highlights

These are the talks I enjoyed the most:

  - preventive controls which denies deployment of non-compliant workloads / data stores.
  - be able to automatically generate reports on the current compliance state.
* **Bypassing Dynamic Taint Analyzers** _Yufei Wu_ \
  interesting theoretical talk on how type confusion vulnerabilities interferes with
  dynamic analysis (DAST).
  On the inherent flaws of DAST frameworks where type information is
  within the application checks are within the runtime, potentially
  enabling bypass attacks.
  Demonstrated how type confusion vulnerabilities (CVE's) can bypass checks.

## Exploring Umeå

I had some free time in Umeå; the evening on Tuesday before/after dinner,
and after lunch on Wednesday.
And it was put to good use, exploring the city, taking photos, etc.

Honestly Umeå surpassed my expectations, a very beautiful city.
Things to see:
- A river worth seeing.
- A park by the river.
- Lots of art and statues.
- Lots of restaurants and cafés with a lively city life and
  a lot of students running around celebrating.

The weather was amazing with a lot of sun and warm weather.
