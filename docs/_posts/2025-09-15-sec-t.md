I visited
[SEC-T 0x11 (2025)](https://sec-t.org/)
Conference and Community Event.

## Why did I attend SEC-T?

There was a couple of reasons for me deciding to visit SEC-T.

- I've attended SEC-T since 2014.
- [Säkerhetspodcasten](https://sakerhetspodcasten.se/)
  used to be guests / workers at SEC-T several years,
  producing video and audio content for both the pod and for the conference.
- SEC-T also is a supportive organization to
  [Security Fest](https://securityfest.com/) and provided various mentorship,
  support and connections when the Gothenburg conference was set up.
- But these last years we've happily downgraded into regular attendees
  just here to attend the conference.

## SEC-T concept

[About SEC-T](https://sec-t.org/about/) describes itself as:

> _SEC-T is an independent non-profit organization focused on spreading
> understanding about information security within the technology arena.
> SEC-T’s foundational pillars are:_
>
> * _Provide community events to inspire people to enter or stay in the
>   field of information security research._
> * _Be a non-profit organization._
> * _Be independent from other organizations._
> * _Support the global conference ecosystem in a positive and productive
>   way._
>
> [...]

You could also phrase it as one of the early Defcon/BSides/... similar
conferences in Sweden.
And currently the largest "hackish" IT Security conference in Sweden.

## Talks

These are the talks I enjoyed the most:

* **Applied Detections Bypass** by _int0x80_.

  protect your assets.

  proactively find their own misconfigurations.

  commercial software / drivers they employ.

## Villages

* **Lock Pick Village**
  I had some minor successes opening like three locks while listening to the
  conference in my headphones.
  Honestly a lot of luck involved, my lock picking skills are pretty terrible.
  \
  I think I most enjoyed a 3 digit code lock which I first cracked using
  exhaustive search, taking... a bit more than 500 tries...
  Then I concluded I had initially been correct that you can kind-of identify
  the code with your eyes closed feeling the mechanism.
  But if the digit is **7** you may incorrectly identify it as **6** or **8**.
  And one of the wheels had some false set on the other side,
  so if the number was **7** you could misidentify it as **3**.
  So while the lock appeared to have much quicker solutions than exhaustive
  search, it was not easy to exactly identity the correct code with feel alone.
* **Hardware Village**
* **Sticker Village**
* **CTF Village** 

## Other... 

* I met a few colleagues from old employers and customers.
* I said hello to Ulf Frisk, who did amazing presentations some years ago.
* [Cyber Chats & Chill](https://shows.acast.com/cyber-chats-chill)
  was introduced to me by a mutual acquaintance.
  CC&C would be doing interviews with some of the speakers. 
* **SEC-T is growing really huge**.
  There's thousands of faces here, it is hot and crowded.
  Personally I tended to keep in de-populated areas like the upper balcony
  near hardware village, rather than being in the cramped areas.
* **Live-steam** is magical if you want to practice "less social conferencing",
  so all prop's to SEC-T's video crew for a great live-stream.
* **Exploring Stockholm**.
  While we all tout "The West Coast is the Best Coast",
  honestly Stockholm has plenty of places worth seeing,
  with nice parks and alleys not far from Münchenbryggeriet.
  **Skinnarviksberget**, **Monteliusvägen**, **Reimersholmen**,
  **Sjövikstorget**, **Slussen**, **Gamla Stan** etc was included in my
  speedrun of Stockholm.
